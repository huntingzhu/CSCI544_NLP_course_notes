## 1 Terminologies

### 1.1 Limerick

A limerick is a form of poetry in five-line, predominantly anapestic meter with a strict rhyme scheme (AABBA), often humorous and sometimes obscene. The third and fourth lines are shorter than the other three. The following example is a limerick of unknown origin:

```
    The limerick packs laughs anatomical
    Into space that is quite economical.
    But the good ones I've seen
    So seldom are clean
    And the clean ones so seldom are comical.
```
The standard form of a limerick is a stanza of five lines, with the first, second and fifth rhyming with one another and having three feet of three syllables each; and the shorter third and fourth lines also rhyming with each other, but having only two feet of three syllables.

### 1.2 Syllable

A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds. For example, the word water is composed of two syllables: wa and ter. A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants).
