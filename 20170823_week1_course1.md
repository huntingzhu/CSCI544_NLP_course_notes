## 1. Levels of Linguistic Knowledge

### 1.1 Level: Low >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>High
speech, text -> phonetics, phonology, orithography -> morphology -> lexemes -> syntax -> semantics -> pragmatics -> dsicourse

### 1.2 Terminology Explanation:**

- **Phonetics** is the science concerned with the study of speech processes, including the production, perception and the analysis of sounds.  It is closely connected to phonology. （发声学，发声系统，发声>处理>理解）

- **Phonology** is the study of the sound system of a language or languages. （语音学，元音辅音）

- **Orthgraphy**, an orthography is the methodology of writing a language. It includes rules of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation. (正字学，强调字与词的拼写方法和正确性)

- **Morphology**, the term 'morphology' refers to the study of the internal structure of words, and of the systematic form-meaning correspondences between words. For instance, we might observe a form difference and a corresponding meaning difference between the English noun ear and the verb hear.（词法，词态学，注重形式和结构，一个单词的来由可能是多个单词拼接而成）

- **Lexemes**, a lexeme is an abstract unit of morphological analysis in linguistics, that roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single word. For example, in the English language, run, runs, ran and running are forms of the same lexeme, conventionally written as RUN. (词根学，run， runs， running 等属于一个词根)

- **Syntax** is the branch of linguistics that covers the grammatical arrangements of words within sentences, and how we use speech in communication.（语法，句法，词与词之间的排列组合，强调合法性）

- **Semantics** deals with the study of meaning; how we combine words to create meaningful discourse.  It studies the relationship between signs and symbols and what they represent. It is also used in logic as the principles that determine truth-values of formulas within a logical system.（语义学，词与词之间不同的排列组合代表了不同的语义）

- **Pragmatics** (as applied to linguistics) is about how we actually use speech in communication, and how context aids the transmission of meaning in utterances. Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g., grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors.（语用学，强调不同语言环境下，表达语义的区别）

- **Discourse**, a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences (relations among signs) between and among objects, subjects, and statements. The term discursive formation conceptually describes the regular communications (written and spoken) that produce such discourses. （论述，演讲，强调长篇幅的文章和演讲中的前后文逻辑关系）
